# Finding-the-hidden-message-in-bacterial-ORI
The script starts by taking the ori sequence of a bacterium and dividing it into k-mers of a specified length (the expected length of the DNaA box based on the DNaA protein). It then calculates the frequency of each k-mer within the ori, storing these counts in a dictionary. Next, it identifies the most frequently occurring k-mers and checks whether any of them are reverse complements of one another. Lastly, the script examines whether these frequent k-mers and their reverse complements are clustered specifically within the ori region or if they are common across the entire genome.

This process mimics how we might computationally pinpoint hidden messages in DNA that mark critical biological functions.
