# Finding-the-hidden-message-in-bacterial-ORI
This python program solves the hidden message problem using the bacterial ori and genomic sequence. It Characterizes the bacterial ori by locating its DNaA boxes, which facilitates the beginning of genome replication. First of all, it takes the ori sequence of a bacterium and breaks it into k-mers of specified lengths, storing the frequency of each k-mer within the ori in a dictionary. Next, it finds the most frequently occuring k-mers and checks which of them are reverse-complemnts of one another. Lastly, it check if the most frequent k-mers and their reverse-complements are clumped specifically in the ori region or if they are common across the entire genome.
